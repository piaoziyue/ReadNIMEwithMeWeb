## Book: The Neuroscience of Singing - The Oxford Handbook of Singing
Kleber, Boris A., and Jean Mary Zarate, 'The Neuroscience of Singing', in Graham F. Welch, David M. Howard, and John Nix (eds), The Oxford Handbook of Singing, Oxford Library of Psychology (2019; online edn, Oxford Academic, 1 Apr. 2014), https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199660773.013.015, accessed 30 July 2024.

> Current neural network models of speech motor acquisition (Guenther and Vladusich 2012; Hickok 2012; Houde and Nagarajan 2011; Tian and Poeppel 2010) provide a theoretical framework to explain how we develop voluntary control over intentional vocal utterances, including singing. These models propose that external sensory feedback is required 
> - first to establish a relationship between motor commands and sensory consequences. During this stage, auditory feedback influences the attempted reproductions of the desired sound by detecting auditory errors and subsequently triggering corrective vocal motor commands; 
> - After the mapping between auditory and motor processes has been solidified, a feedforward model makes predictions about the current state of the vocal tract components and the sensory consequences of vocal tract movements. The cerebellum and premotor areas—cortical areas that select or prepare motor programs for M1—are associated with this feedforward prediction model, which becomes more and more accurate with each repetition until it generates little to no auditory error. At this stage, auditory feedback is used mainly to update the prediction model and/or to perform corrections in case of prediction errors or perturbations. Simultaneously, the somatosensory control subsystem within S1 and other related cortical regions develops a somatosensory representation for the auditory-motor mapping that was learned. The somatosensory representation develops later in vocal learning and thus requires more practice and time, during which the somatosensory inputs can fine-tune aspects of feedforward auditory predictions; particular auditory targets can also co-activate the corresponding somatosensory targets (Hickok et al. 2011). Lametti et al. (2012, p. 9357) suggest that an individual’s learning experience with somatosensory versus auditory feedback during speech development could shape the sensitivity to a particular type of feedback. This difference could be of potential interest to voice teachers, who may focus on only one of these sensory streams in their didactic approach.

Imitative learning issues in singing

> if self-voice auditory feedback is not the optimal way of accurate vocal control, then how do professional singers manage to achieve the demanded high standard of vocal mastery? The theory that opera singers use a combination of kinesthetic, vibratory and auditory feedback to accurately control their voice has long been supported [80]. This view is accord with cognitive research on speech somatosensory feedback [81, 82] and even more so with what the latest Neuroscience studies seem to indicate. Research on the cognitive mechanisms during singing has shown proof that professional opera singers tend to have an increased volume of gray matter in the ventral primary somatosensory cortex of the brain, and in particular at the centers corresponding to organs associated with the mechanism of the voice [
55
]. This, combined with the observation of increased activation of the above brain regions of singers during singing, suggests a particularly heightened kinesthetic perception of the "vocal instrument" [
56
].

This ability seems to stem from the need of professional singers to gradually learn to rely more on somatosensory rather than their auditory feedback. This indicates that they learn to better control their vocal mechanism in order to create the physical conditions that will allow the production of the desired sound [
[54]
, 
[55]
, 
[56]
]. Such high level of control is necessary, considering that somatosensory control of voice onset is activated from the moment when sound preparation begins, while auditory feedback exists only after a vocal sound has already begun to be emitted and we are then able to hear it.
