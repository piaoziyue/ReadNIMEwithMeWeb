## Title: "Breath Support Directives Used by Singing Teachers: A Delphi Study"

### Author: Spillane, Kathleen Wilson

### Problems

#### confusing feelings P2
Voice teachers have traditionally used verbal and non-verbal directives to teach singing, often concentrating on the way singing "feels" rather than physiological and acoustic function. This approach may be confusing to the student, who may not share the teacher's perceptions.

#### no system or exam P1
It has no system of accountability and no proficiency exam to pass in order to practice the profession
Ingo Titze, " Standardization in Voice Research " NATS Bulletin, vol. 42, no. 2 (Nov./Dec. 1985): 30-31.

#### communication between the singing and scientific professions is difficult.
* lack consistent terminology
* scientists attempt to apply scientific solutions to artistic problems, often with inartistic results

#### complex breathing muscles groups, only one set of muscles is impossible

#### "measurements of the chest wall kinematics in male professional singers did not coincide with those singers’ own perceptions."


### Methods of teaching breathing
using the Delphi Method: allow experts to arrive at a consensus

#### Some verbal directives regarding support concepts and their effects upon resultant sung tone. Swank H 2984

Evaluation:
1. Comparison of the numbers of partials in the tone [14 Swank, pp. 13-14].
2. The stability of the vowel formants, both in frequency and in relative intensity.
3. Changes in the presence and intensity of the "Singer's Formant."
4. Ability to sustain tone for the requested length of time.
5. Relative stability in the intensity of tone over time.

Result:
D7 was ranked highest, D1, D4, D5 and D6 (tied) and D2 and D3 (tied).

Problems:
* how or why these directives were chosen
* discrepancies exist between singing teachers and voice scientists
* Interacting variables such as differences in singers (subjects were not randomly chosen), and the effect of subjects being given all seven directives in succession.

* #17: "Breathing for singing should approximate breathing while lying down and at rest. Lower torso expansion and contraction (the bellows effect) is more easily achieved while prone."
* #8: "Focus tone properly so that breath supports the tone rather than passing through it."
* #16: "Imitate a siren."
* #68: "Practice making a sustained hissing sound for as long as possible; try to beat that time by 1 second a day, 10 times in succession."
* #7: "In a comfortably seated or standing position, shoulder/neck area relaxed, inhale and exhale comfortably. [Then] begin vocalizing at the speaking level. Then follow with melodic exercises."
* #52: "The muscles used to sneeze or cough are the same used for breathing; the only difference in singing is the motion is slower and controlled."


### Support vs. Steady Airflow: The Effect of Two Different Instructions on Subglottal Pressure, Sound Pressure Level, and Airflow Rate During Singing and Speaking -- Kim, Sunyoung

(A) Sing the way you usually sing (baseline); 
(B) Allow your breath to flow steadily with the clear [ɑ] vowels
(C) Keep the tone well supported with the clear [ɑ] vowels
