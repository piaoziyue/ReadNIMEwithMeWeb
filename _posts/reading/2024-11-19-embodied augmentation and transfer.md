## Paper: Getting into someone else's soul: communicating embodied experience

### Authors: Claudia Núñez-Pacheco, Lian Loke

> there is an inherent quality that keeps us connected means that intersubjective engagement goes beyond the direct interaction between bodies

>  Embodied interaction introduced by Dourish (Dourish, P. 2001. Where the Action Is: The Foundations of Embodied Interaction. ) understands the property of direct engagement with a world of shared meaning, mainly focusing on the interaction with technological artefacts

> Finally, altered embodiment refers to the possibility of interaction with augmented or intervened senses. An example of this approach would alter human senses into perceiving through the senses of an animal (Flanagan, P., and R. Frankjaer. 2018. “Rewilding Wearables: Sympoeitic Interfaces for Empathic Experience of Other-than-Human Entities.” TEI), or even into someone else's world. From these described approaches, an intersubjective embodiment can be mediated through altering perception by representing specific traits of a third person's experience into a prototype. We use this altered embodied modality in our installation SOUL.

The papge is mainly reviewed motor learning models for different learning stages.
#### Dynamic System Theory

#### ecological dynamics

* 知觉-行动耦合（Perception-Action Coupling）：

生态动力学认为，学习运动技能是个体通过感知环境（如球的位置、对手的动作）和相应的行动之间的紧密耦合来实现的。感知和行动是不可分割的，运动员在与环境的互动中不断调整自己的行为。
约束理论（Constraints Theory）：

* 约束（Constraints）是指个体学习过程中受到的各种影响因素，通常分为：
个体约束（Individual Constraints）：如体能、身高、力量等。
环境约束（Environmental Constraints）：如场地条件、天气、队友等。
任务约束（Task Constraints）：如比赛规则、球的大小等。
生态动力学强调，运动技能的学习是通过这些约束之间的动态相互作用来实现的。
生态效应（Affordances）：

* 生态效应是指个体在环境中感知到的可供行动的机会。例如，一个运动员在篮球比赛中感知到可以投篮的机会，就被称为“可供性”或“生态效应”。个体的行动选择取决于他们对这些生态效应的感知。

## Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) model

This model could be used to analysis the challenges, PI, TI

Holistic Integration: TPACK integrates three key areas: Content Knowledge (CK), Pedagogical Knowledge (PK), and Technological Knowledge (TK). In your study, CK relates to the challenges of singing (e.g., muscle coordination, tension relief), PK relates to the traditional teaching methods used by vocal coaches (e.g., kinesthetic exercises, metaphors, physical feedback), and TK relates to potential technological tools (e.g., visualization techniques, tactile feedback devices).

Emphasis on Pedagogical Appropriateness: The model helps you analyze not only how technologies can be used but also how they can be best aligned with pedagogical strategies. This means you can discuss how technologies like visualization tools (e.g., spectrograms, dynamic X-ray-like visuals) and tactile feedback devices can complement and enhance current pedagogical interventions.

Focus on Knowledge Transfer: The TPACK model highlights the effective transfer of knowledge using technology-enhanced pedagogy. You can explore how each technological intervention (e.g., TI1: Visualization Techniques, TI2: Tactile Feedback Devices) helps students internalize complex kinesthetic concepts, such as managing airflow or coordinating muscles.

### How to Use TPACK in Your Discussion:
* Content Knowledge (CK): Analyze each challenge (e.g., C1: Muscle Coordination and Adjustment) to understand what specific singing skills are needed and why these skills are challenging.
  
* Pedagogical Knowledge (PK): Describe how current pedagogical interventions (e.g., PI1: Kinesthetic Exercises and Tools) aim to address these challenges and how they align with the principles of embodied learning.

* Technological Knowledge (TK): For each challenge, discuss how technological interventions can support the pedagogy. For example: 

  * C1 (Muscle Coordination and Adjustment): TI1 (Visualization Techniques) could help singers better understand their internal bodily processes, such as diaphragm movement, making abstract concepts more concrete through real-time biofeedback.
  
  * C2 (Recognizing and Alleviating Muscle Tension): TI2 (Tactile Feedback Devices) can provide direct, physical feedback to help singers understand when they are activating muscles unnecessarily and develop more effective tension relief techniques.

e.g.
* Substitution: Using visualization tools to substitute for traditional imagery or verbal descriptions of breathing.
* Augmentation: Visualization tools that augment feedback on breathing technique, providing real-time internal visuals (e.g., airflow and diaphragm movement).
* Modification: Using tactile feedback devices that offer biofeedback, modifying the approach from verbal coaching to physically experienced feedback.
* Redefinition: Using technology to create entirely new learning experiences (e.g., immersive VR simulations for vocal practice in a virtual environment with real-time physiological feedback).

> We also know from prior research that differences in context contribute to (sometimes vastly) different educational outcomes (Design-Based Research Design-Based Research Collective 2003; Kelchtermans 2014)
