# Respiratory Function in Singing - A Primer for Singer and Singing Teachers

## Chapter 1: structure

* the main interest for respiratory organs are the torso and the lower neck

### Apparatus

* Recipiratory apparatus two mainly subdivision:
  * pulmonary apparatus 
  * chest wall.
* reciprocating air pump


#### Pulmonary(related to lung) apparatus: 
* conduct air and hold air, allow for gas exchange (provide oxygen and remove carbon dioxygen from cells).
* left and right main bronchi -> right into three lobar bronchi and left into two -> segmental bronchi -> subsegmental bronchi -> small bronchi -> terminal broncho -> bronchioles, terminal bronchioles, respitatory bronchioles ->  alveolar ducts -> alveolar sacs -> alveoli...

* the layer of lung
  * cover visceral pleura (airtight membrane). Abundant of elastic fibers and behave like a strachable bag
  * Double wall sac
    * companion membrane: parietal pleura
    * all coated with liquid

#### chest wall
* Rib cage wall
  *  consist of bones and cartilage
  *  12 vertebrae -> 24 downwards bones -> costal (rib) cartilage -> sternum (breastbone) 
  *  upper bones attach to sternum with their own cartilage, lower share cartilage, the last two float without front attachment
  * rest: pectoral girdle. Front two clavicles (from sternum to scapulae ) ![](../images/1-5%20Pectoral_girdle_front_diagram.png)


* Diaphragm

  * dome shape structure, separate the throaz to the abdomen
  * center tendom: non elastic
  * connect to costal cartilge 7-10 & 11-12, xiphoid process, and also lumbar spine (腰椎) and arcuate ligaments
  * Spinal Vertebra C3 4 5 make it alive

* abdominal wall
  * ![](../images/1-7-1pelvic-girdle-diagram-ireland-dublin-help.jpeg)
  * pelvic girdle: two coxal bones and sacral and coccygeal; vertebrae
  * sheets of connective tissue 结缔组织
  * muscles鸥鸟他和front back and flanks

* abdominal content

## Chapter 2: mechanics

### forces
* passive force: natural recoil of structures. depend on the amount of air. 
  * expire (force air out): more air more force
  * inspire: less air more force
* active force: from muscles and air
  * more air, greater expiratory force
  * less air, greater inspiratory force

### related muscles

#### rib cage wall
* includes muscles of neck and rib cage
  * sternocleidomastoid: originate from skull behind ear, attach to the top of sternum and end of clavicle ![](../images/2-1Sternocleidomastoid_muscle_anterior_view_-_Kenhub.png)
  * scalenus斜角肌: include anterior medius and posterior scalenus. originate from C3-C6 cervical vertebrae, run down to 1st rib ![](../images/2-2Scalenus.png)
  * pectoralis major 胸大肌
  * pectoralis minor 胸小肌
  * subclavius
  * serratus anterior
  * external intercostals: from ribs leave the vertebrea
  * internal intercostals: from sternum

#### abdominal wall
![](../images/2-3ab%20muscles.jpeg)
* rectus abdominis: 
  * contract pull downward lower ribs and sternum; force the front of abdominal wall inward
* external oblique
  * contract: pull downward the lower ribs and forces the front and side of abdominal wall inward

### movement

#### rib cage wall
* end of ribs: upward-and-forward; downward-and-backward
* sides of rib cage: upward-and-forward; downward-and-backward
* small movement can result large quantity of air

#### diaphragm
* movement cannot be seen but can be infer by the movement of rib cage wall and abdominal wall
* change the radius of curvature and a flattening
* need to move a greater distance for the same amount of air than rib cage wall
* depend on combinations of relative fixation of the lower six ribs and central tendon

#### abdominal wall
* movement depends on body type and abdominal muscle tone
* wall, especially bottom, is protrude
* two types of movement
  * increase radius of curvature
  * decrease in radius of curvation and a flattening of the wall
