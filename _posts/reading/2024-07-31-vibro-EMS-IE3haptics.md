## Participatory Design for In-Vehicle Vibrotactile Warnings on Driver’s Seat

### main problem identification

> However, previous studies predominantly followed a top-down approach, where
experts designed vibrotactile warning patterns, and users merely evaluated them.
The outcomes may fail to incorporate user expectations faithfully. For instance, in
Chang et al. [4], expert-crafted vibrotactile warnings on a seat resulted in faster
reaction times than visual and auditory warnings, but they received significantly
lower scores in subjective intuitiveness and learnability. This discrepancy between
quantitative performance and user experience was attributed to the unfamiliarity
of vibrotactile warnings to regular drivers.

### main contribution:

This work adopts a participatory design using a vibration
authoring tool to fully utilize user-defined design and determine representative patterns for various warning scenarios.

### interface design:

    - The seat featured three strong voice-coil actuators (diameter 74 mm, height
25 mm, and resonance frequency 70 Hz).

### experiment

The experimenter provided a comprehensive overview of
the study’s objectives and procedure to participants. Then, participants familiarized themselves with the eight warning scenarios using the driving simulator
for 10 minutes. They also underwent a practice session for 10 minutes to learn
the functions of the vibration authoring tool with the experimenter’s guidance.
We did not inform participants of specific authoring techniques, such as moving
phantom sensations and their creation methods, to ensure that their intuitions
remained genuine and unaltered.
After the orientation, participants designed vibrotactile patterns for each
warning scenario using the authoring tool. Participants could experience designed
warnings while driving on the simulator whenever they wanted. Participants
wore noise-canceling headphones that played driving sounds while blocking other
external sounds, such as the vibration actuator noise. They were instructed
to design and experience as many patterns as possible. The order of the eight
warning scenarios was balanced across participants using a Latin square to
minimize sequencing bias. Participants could take a break whenever they wanted.
This design procedure took approximately 60 minutes.


### evaluation
    - established criteria to classify raw vibration signals into mutually exclusive classes and identified the __most frequent vibration classes__
    - computed the median pulse count, mean pulse on/off durations, and mean intensity
    - regenerated representative vibrotactile patterns for each of the eight warning scenarios using the parameters of the most frequent pattern classes obtained from Step 2.
  
### user experience matric

> The measures were Utility, Intuitiveness, Learnability, and Saliency
for the practical aspects, Atotelics (the vibrotactile signal feels good on its own)
and Luxuriousness for the hedonic aspects, and Satisfaction and Valuability
(likelihood to purchase) for the overall evaluation. These metrics were determined
by referring to the questionnaires on in-vehicle collision warning systems [15]
and haptic experiences [14]. The experiment took approximately 90 minutes,
including a 10-minute break in the middle.
  
### findings

The main findings from the study can be summarized as follows:

1. **User Comprehension and Preferences**: Researchers often overestimate users' ability to understand complex vibration patterns, while users generally prefer simpler and clearer patterns.

2. **Design Similarities for Collision Warnings**: Both researchers and users showed consistent design strategies for collision warnings, typically using repetitive pulses, continuous vibration, and high amplitudes. The vibration locations were aligned with the directions of potential collisions, reflecting practices in prior research.

3. **Discrepancies in Non-Collision Warnings**: Differences emerged between researchers and users in designing warnings unrelated to collisions. Researchers targeted specific areas like the thighs or the front for attention, while users preferred more general stimulation, such as targeting all areas or focusing on the back.

4. **Importance of Participatory Design**: The study highlights the need for more research on non-collision warnings and suggests that participatory design, involving users in the design process with appropriate tools, can enhance the design of vibration signals, especially for new and unfamiliar applications.
