## 2001: Problems and Prospects for Intimate Musical Control of Computers
### Authors: David Wessel and Matthew Wright
Perhaps if we could better capture and theorize the experiences of skilled practitioners as contributions to knowledge, then themes of performance, expertise, experience, artistry, and control could become more prominent to the betterment of both communities 

* A Conceptual framework for describing controller research and development

Our human performer has intentions to produce a certain musical result. These intentions are communicated to the body’s sensorimotor system (“motor program”). Parameters are sensed from the body at the gestural interface. These parameters are then passed to controller software that conditions, tracks, and maps them to the algorithms that generate the musical material.

## Gestural control of sound synthesis

Another unsolved discussion relates to the interest of ergonomically designed, easy-to-use, and intuitive interfaces for musical control. Several authors consider that new devices designed according to ergonomical and cognitive principles can become general tools for music performance [76], [81]–​[83]. Other authors claim that effort demanding and hard-to-play instruments are the only ones that provide expressive possibilities to a performer, linking the concepts of effort and expression [84] [85] [86].
