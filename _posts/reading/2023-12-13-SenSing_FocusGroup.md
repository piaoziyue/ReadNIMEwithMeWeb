## Singing & focus group

### study 2 in paper: An investigation of singing, health and well-being as a group process. -- Liz Mellor

#### Singing and well-being five categories: musical, expression, psychosocial, physical body, spiritual

#### Focus group settings
* three focos groups, each 1.5 hours
* each focus group including 8 students and 2 researchers

### general question focus group with singers
Musical identities ofprofessional jazz musicians: a focus group investigation
authors: Raymond Macdonald, Graeme Wilson

### General focus group

#### What is a focus-group?
Lederman (see Thomas et al. 1995): ‘a technique involving the use of in-depth group interviews in which participants are selected because they are a purposive, although not necessarily representative, sampling of a specific population, this group being ‘focused’ on a given topic’

#### when to use focus group
* provide information about a range of ideas and feelings that individuals have about certain issues
* illuminate the differences in perspective between groups of individuals

#### condition
* something to say on the topic
* have similar socio-characteristics 
  * gender group
  * age-range
  * ethnic
  * social class background
* would be comfortable talking to the interviewer and each other 
  * most researchers: better don't know each other. e.g. Thomas et al. 1995
  * Kitzinger (1994) advocate pre-existing groups (possibly used in sensitive and personal issues)

#### focus group vs one-to-one interview
* gather large amount of data in a short time
* group dynamics: the social interaction of the group are deeper and richer

#### group moderator!!!
* manage the existing relationship
* create an environment in which the participants who do not know each other feel relaxed 
* encouraged to engage and exchange feelings

#### Note taker
* observe non-verbal interaction
* impact of group dynamics
* exchanges of views
* general content of discussion

#### number
* number of focus groups
  * Krueger (1994): continuing with running focus groups until a clear pattern emerges and subsequent groups produce only repetitious information
  * for a simple research question: 3-5 focus groups Burrows & Kendall, 1997).
* number of participants
  * Krueger & Casey (2000): 6-8; 
  * 6-10 is managable/gain variety of perspectives

#### problems
1. lack of confidence individuals
2. non-attender: over-recruit 10-25%
3. subjectivity: since questions design, need to indicate an extent of selective answers and interpretations of the issue under investigation. Data analysis need ot be systematic, sequential, verifiable, and continuous (Krueger & Casey (2000))

#### data analysis: general
* reduce data: extra and irrelevant information
* number of stages: Yin 1989
* the purpose drive the analysis

#### data analysis: framework analysis by Ritchie & Spencer (1994)
* stage 1: familiarization
* stage 2: identifying a thematic framework: writing memos in the margin of text
* stage 3: indexing: comprises sifting the data, highlighting and sorting out quotes and making comparisons both within and between cases
* stage 4: charting: involves lifting the quotes from their original context and re-arranging them under the newly-developed
* step 5: mapping and interpretation

### Gestalt practice and arts-based management training -- Naoum Liotas

#### Gestalt:
The figure-ground principle states that people instinctively perceive objects as either being in the foreground or the background.

Most art-based training methods (for example, drawing, poetry, storytelling, theatrical games or improvizations, etc) have the potential to use the bodies of the trainees and involve them holistically in the training session. This is essential for cultivating‘presence’ – used here to mean being present in the moment, while also including elements such as being authentic, maintaining ‘creative indifference’ and practising inclusion (Denham, 2006). The concept of presence, also of significant importance in Gestalt practice, is defined by Nevis (1987) as ‘... the ability of the trainer, consultant or coach to be aware of what he or she evokes in other people as a consequence of being in the same space with trainees’
