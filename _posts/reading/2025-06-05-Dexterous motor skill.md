# Skilful force control in expert pianists

## what is Dexterous motor skill
> Dexterous object manipulation in skilful behaviours such as surgery, craft making, and musical performance involves fast, precise, and efficient control of force with the fingers. ... "all of which require skilful control of force in the fingers"

## can be cited

> Musical performance has some unique features that differ from other object manipulation tasks that have been extensively investigated, such as grasping and pinching, which include instantaneous increases and decreases of force , and repetitive production of force with various spatiotemporal features to manipulate multifaceted acoustical features, such as tempo, loudness, rhythm, and timbre.

## what is Dexterous motor skill
> Dexterity, or the speed of coordinated movement, has long been considered an important aspect of hand function Davis (955) presented the ability to deploy the fingers with dexterity as a component of hand function and listed precision and fine coordination as elements for its evaluation.

> As early as 1949, Super differentiated between gross and fine dexterity, stating that tests for arm and hand coordination require gross movement, whereas fine assembly work involving the wrist and fingers requires fine dexterity. More recently, Fleishman and Ellison (962) and Fleishman (972) identified 11 bases of skilled performance, one of which was fine dexterity, which was differentiated from manual dexterity.
