# what is a theory
therory: helps us understand phenomena and explains the reasons why these phenomena exist or behave as they do

## **a good theory (Stephen Hawking (1996))**
1) accurately describe a large class of observations
2) it must make definite predictions about the results of future observations

* the study of human motor control and learning, theories focus on explaining human behavior

## a good motor control theory
* For motor skill: A skilled basketball player can shoot a one-hand jump shot from a variety of locations and in a variety of game-related situations. **A good theory of motor control will explain why this capability is possible**.
* Can help instructors develop effective skill instruction and practice environments
* An important goal of behaviorally based motor control theories is to **propose laws and principles that govern coordinated human motor behavior**; neural-level theory would be expected to **describe neural mechanisms or neural mechanism interactions that explain how the nervous system is involved in these behavioral principles**

## Key problem 1: Coordination
a person’s organization of the activation of muscles in such a way that the goal of an action can be accomplished.

Defination by Turvey (1990): coordination is the patterning of **head, body, and limb movements** relative to the patterning of environmental objects and events

## Keu problem 2: degree of freedom
Compare to helicopter: The helicopter designer must enable the pilot to control many different features so that the helicopter can do all these things. And the designer must help the pilot do so as simply as possible.

* which level of control we are considering， e.g. motor units as the elements that must be controlled; joints as the element of interest

# Embodied Learning [1]
Embodied learning occurs when the meaning of what is learned is grounded in body movement and perception.


# Motor skills 

## Related terms
* **Skills/actions**: activity or task that has a specific purpose or goal to achieve [2]

* **Motor skills**: (a) an activity or task that has a specific purpose or goal to achieve; (b) an indicator of quality of performance. [2]
* **Characteristic of motor skills**: (1) have a purpose (2) voluntarily (3) require movement of joints and body segments (4) need to be learned or relearned
* **Fine motor skills**: greater control of the small muscles, especially those involved in hand-eye coordination, and require a high degree of precision in hand and finger movement
* **gross motor skill**: a motor skill that requires the use of large musculature to achieve the goal of the skill.

* **movements**: specific patterns of motion among joints and body segments used to accomplish action goals.

* **Motor Learning**: the acquisition of motor skills, the performance enhancement of learned or highly experienced motor skills, or the reacquisition of skills that are difficult to perform or cannot be performed because of injury, disease, and the like. Of interest are the behavioral and/or neurological changes that occur as a person learns a motor skill and the variables that influence those changes. [2]


## motor control [2]
how our neuromuscular system functions to activate and coordinate the muscles and limbs involved in the performance of a motor skill. Researchers may investigate this question while a person is learning a new skill or performing a welllearned or highly experienced skill.

## motor development
both motor learning and control, primarily interested in the relationship between these issues and human development from infancy to old age

motor skill performance is influenced by the 
(1) motor skill, 
(2) performance environment, 
(3) physical and psychological characteristics of the person performing the skill 

## Motor control theory

### open loop and closed loop control systems
* The **control center** is sometimes referred to as an executive. An important part of its role is to generate and issue movement instructions to the effectors, which, in the human, are the muscles of the limbs, body, and/or head involved in producing desired movement

* **open-loop control system** a control system in  which all the information needed to initiate and carry out an action as planned is contained in the initial instructions to the effectors.  
* **closed-loop control system** a system of control in which, during the course of an action, feedback is compared against a standard or reference to enable an action to be carried out as planned.

* **Feedback**: afferent information sent by the various sensory receptors to the control center to update the control center about the correctness of the movement while it is in progress, similar to response

## Learning theory
Learning cannot be observed directly, but can only be inferred from characteristics of a person’s performance. it is possible that our inference is incorrect, for example some **performance variables** can influence, like the situation, the uniqueness of the setting, fatigue, and so on.

* **Learning**: a change in the capability of a person to perform a skill that must be inferred from a relatively permanent improvement in performance as a result of practice or experience

### six performance characteristics for skill learning
*a* **Improvement**; 

*b* **Consistency**: performance becomes increasingly more consistent, performance characteristics should become more similar

*c* **Stability**: influence on skill performance of perturbations, which are internal (e.g. pressure) or external conditions (environment) that can disrupt performance

*d* **Persistence**: the person progresses in learning the skill, the improved performance capability lasts over increasing periods of time

*e* **Adaptability**: the improved performance is adaptable to a variety of performance context characteristics

*f* **Reduction of attention demand**: 
  * use **dual-task procedure**: exermine the amount of ttention required to perform an action. **Primary task** means the task of interest, whose performance experimenters are observing in order to assess its attention demands, **second task** will be given degree of interference. E.g. As a person walks from one end of a hallway to the other, he or she must listen to words spoken through earphones; when the person hears each word, he or she must repeat the word that was spoken just prior to that word.

### learning assessment techniques
* observing practice performance
* Performance Curves for Outcome Measures
* Performance curves for kinematic measures. do different trials (P 263, figure 11.3)

* **retention test** test of a practiced skill that a learner performs following an interval of time after practice has ceased.  
* **transfer test** test in which a person performs a skill that is different from the skill he or she practiced or performs the practiced skill in a context or situation different from the practice context or situation

* **freezing the degrees of freedom** common initial strategy of beginning learners to control the many degrees of freedom associated with the coordination demands of a motor skill; the person holds some joints rigid (i.e., “freezes” them) and/or couples joint motions together in tight synchrony while performing the skill.

## learning stages

### FITTS AND POSNER THREE-STAGE MODEL
* **1st cognitive stage**: the  beginner1 focuses on cognitively oriented problems related to what to do and how to do it. Usually with a lot of errors. e.g. What is my objective? How far should I move this arm? What is the best way to hold this implement? Where should this arm be when my right leg is here? Additionally, the learner must engage in cognitive activity as he or she listens to instructions and receives feedback from the instructor.
* **2nd associative stage**: after an unspecified amount of practice and performance improvement. The practioner associate specific environmental cues with the movements required to achieve the goal of the skill. less errors and also called refining stage
* **3rd autonomous stage**: people can consciously think about their movements while performing the skill, because they can perform it without conscious thought. often can do another task at the same time.

### GENTILE’S TWO-STAGE MODEL (for beginner)
* **Initial stage** : 1) **acquire a movement pattern** that will allow some degree of success at achieving the action goal of the skill; 2) **discriminate between regulatory and nonregulatory conditions** in the environmental context in which he or she performs the skill
* **Later stages if learning**
  * First, the person must develop the capability of **adapting** the movement pattern to the specific demands of any performance situation requiring that skill. 
  * Second, the person must increase his or her **consistency** in achieving the goal of the skill. 
  * Third, the person must learn to perform the skill with an **economy of effort**.


### Bernstein provided one of the most comprehensive descriptions of how difficult it is to acquire a new skills
* stage one to **decide which level in the motor control system will take the leading role in directing the performance**: Bernstein argued that the level of Actions (level D), which emerged later in human evolution, typically takes the lead, directing the evolutionary older levels that have as their responsibility coordinating movements with external space (level C), organizing muscular synergies (level B), and regulating muscle tone (level A).
* stage two: **developing a plan or strategy to approach the problem** (specifying how the skill will look from the outside) and recruiting and assigning roles to the lower levels of the motor control system.
* stage three: identifying the most appropriate sensory corrections (specifying how the skill should feel from the inside). the learner may consciously direct attention to the numerous details associated with controlling the movement, providing a form of temporary scaffolding while level B elaborates genuine corrections that can be employed automatically.
* stage four: the corrections are handed over to the background levels and so are typically engaged without conscious awareness.

### performance assessment parameters
* **Rate of improvement**: The amount of improvement decreases (power law of practice).  
* **Movement coordination**: To control the many degrees of freedom required by a skill, the beginner initially “freezes” certain joints but eventually allows the limb segments involved to work together as a functional synergy.  
* **Complexity of control**: The complexity of the underlying control mechanism may increase or decrease depending on task demands.  
* **Altering an old or preferred coordination pattern**: Learners typically use preferred patterns of coordination initially, but these patterns lose stability with practice and are replaced by stable and more functional coordination patterns.  
* **Muscles involved**: The number of muscles activated by a beginner decreases with practice; the timing pattern of muscle activation becomes optimal for successful performance.  
* **Energy cost/movement efficiency**: The amount of energy beginners use decreases; movement efficiency increases.  
* **Visual selective attention**: Visual attention  increasingly becomes directed specifically to appropriate sources of information.  
* **Conscious attention**: The amount of conscious attention given to the movement characteristics of a skill is reduced.  
* **Error detection and attention**: The capability to detect and correct one’s own performance errors increases.  
* **Brain activity**: Specific brain regions activated during the initial stage of learning are not always the same areas activated during later stages. Processing efficiency increases.

### who is expert
* Expertise is typically the result of deliberate practice for **a minimum of ten years**.  
* Experts have a knowledge structure that is organized into more concepts related to performing the activity, and they are better able to interrelate the concepts. However, the knowledge structure is activity specific.  
* Experts who perform in activities that involve severe time constraints for decision making and anticipation visually search the performance environment in a way that allows them to select more meaningful information in a short amount of time.  
* Experts may resist allowing all aspects of their performance to become automated to enable continued improvements and adaptation to new situations.

### transfer of learning as the influence of previous experiences on performing a skill in a new context or on learning a new skill.
  
## demostration related
* **modeling** the use of demonstration as a means of conveying information about how to perform a skill.
* what a person actually “sees” when a skill is demonstrated
* demo from skilled one
  * after viewing a skilled demostration: Schoenfelder-Zohdi (1992): participants who had observed the skilled demonstration developed coordinated movement patterns earlier in practice than did those who had not observed the demonstration. full-body demonstrations are not necessary to bring about changes in coordination.
  * influence of demonstration on skill acquisition depends on characteristics of the skill being learned. Most important characteristic: **acquisition of a new pattern of coordination**
  * usually a skilled demostration communicates the invariant characteristics of a movement pattern
* beginner observe beginner sometime is also helpful: discourages imitation of a skilled model’s performance of the skill and encourages the observer to engage in more active problem solving
  * maybe provide the observer of the pair with a checklist of key aspects of the skill.

### how to observe demo's influence learning
* **cognitive mediation theory**: he or she translates the observed movement information into a symbolic memory code that forms the basis of a stored representation in memory
  * **attention process**, which involves what the person observes and the information he or she extracts from the model’s actions
  * **retention process**, in which the person transforms and restructures what he or she observes into symbolic codes that the person stores in memory
  * **behavior reproduction process**: person translates the memory representation of the modeled action and turns it into physical action.
  * **motivation process**: incentive or motivation to perform the modeled action. This process, then, focuses on all those factors that influence a person’s motivation to perform

* Dynamic view of modeling
  * challenge the need for a symbolic coding step: The visual system “picks up” from the model salient information that effectively constrains the body and limbs to act in specific ways. The person does not need to transform the information received via the visual system into a cognitive code and store it in memory.

* **that actions will be more effective when a person focuses his or her attention on the intended outcomes of an action, rather than on the movements required by the skill**

## Verbal Instructions and Cues  
* Several attention-related factors are important to consider when using verbal instructions to communicate how to perform a motor skill:  
  * The amount of information included in verbal instructions should take into account learners’ attention-capacity limitations.  
  * According to the action effect hypothesis, verbal instructions should direct the learner’s focus of attention to movement outcomes rather than to the movements themselves.  
  * Novice learners can learn invariant environmental context regulatory conditions without conscious awareness of them (i.e., implicit learning), although attention focus on the environmental context is important.  
  * Instructions influence the novice learner to direct attention to certain performance goals, which influences the strategies the learner uses to begin practicing a skill.  
  
* Verbal cues are short, concise phrases that serve to  
  * Direct the performer’s attention to regulatory conditions in the environmental context.  
  * Prompt key movement components of skills.  

# Augment feedback

## feedback: a generic term that describes information people receive about their performance of a motor skill during or after the performance.

## types of augmented feedback
* **Knowledge of Results**: externally presented information about the outcome of an attempt to perform a skill. e.g. “The shot was in the blue at 9 o’clock,” the teacher is providing performance outcome information.
* **knowledge of performance**: movement characteristics that led to the performance outcome. e.g. in the archery situation described earlier, the teacher could provide KP by telling the student that he or she pulled the bow to the left at the release of the arrow.

## when augmented feedback is essential
* some skill performance contexts do not make critical sensory feedback available to the person.
* because of injury, disease, and the like, the person does not have available the sensory pathways needed to detect critical task-intrinsic feedback for the skill he or she is learning
* in some situations the appropriate taskintrinsic feedback provides the necessary information and the person’s sensory system is capable of detecting it, but the person cannot use the feedback. For example, a person learning to extend a knee a certain distance or to throw a ball at a certain rate of speed may not be able to determine the distance moved or the rate of speed of the throw because of lack of experience. In these situations, augmented feedback helps to make the available task-intrinsic feedback more meaningful to the performer.

**Concern about biofeedback as augment feedback**: An additional concern about the use of biofeedback as augmented feedback is the tendency for people to become dependent on it to help them perform the skill.

## Muscle measurements
* **EMG**: electromyography detect electrical activity in the muscles by either attaching surface electrodes to the skin over muscles or inserting fine wire electrodes into a specific muscle.
  * **Use of EMG**: indicate when a muscle begins and ends activation; the process of movement coordination by observing the sequence of muscle activation patterns
* **wMMG**: Whole muscle mechanomyography is a new and noninvasive term. It detects and measures the lateral displacement of a muscle’s belly following maximal percutaneous neuromuscular stimulation (PNS) via an electric current. One advantage of wMMG over EMG is that growing evidence suggests that it has the potential to estimate muscle fiber composition within a single muscle
* **NIRS**: Near infrared spectroscopy invasive. It essentially determines the level of oxygenation in the muscle. Light of wavelengths between 600 nanometer–1000 nanometer can penetrate skin, bone, fat, and connective tissue where it is either absorbed or scattered, permitting the determination of changes in blood volume as well as changes in the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin, deoxygenated hemoglobin, and oxygenated cytochrome-oxidase.


## EMG related terms

* **reaction time (RT)**: the interval of time between the onset of a signal (stimulus) and the initiation of a response (e.g., the amount of time between the “go” signal for a swimming sprint race start and the beginning of the feet moving off the starting block).

* **Parameters related to EMG**: 
  * **premotor time**: time between stimulation and the EMG onset which show the beginning of the muscle activity. It's a measure of the receipt and transmission of information from the environment, through the nervous system, to the muscle itself. commonly considered an indicator of perceptual and cognitive decision-making activity in which the person engages while preparing an action
  * **motor time**: the period of time from the increase in muscle activity until the actual beginning of observable limb movement. this activity indicates a time lag in the muscle that it needs in order to overcome the inertia of the limb after the muscle receives the command to contract.

## How to access the skill level of a person
* consistently achieve the goal of the task
* achieve the task under a range of different conditions
* the degree of efficiency
  * the strategies they use to solve problems
  * pick up and process information and deploy their attention
  * the amount of muscular effort they use to accomplish a task. Skilled individuals often make difficult tasks look effortless and they can appear to have all the time in the world, even in tasks that impose severe time limitations on the performer.

## how to access error
Accuracy can involve either spatial accuracy, temporal accuracy, or both.
* **Spatial accuracy**: refers to situations involving space dimensions, such as distance
* **Temporal accuracy**: refers to situations involving time dimensions.

### Types of errors
Error measures not only provide indicators of performance accuracy but certain types of error measures also tell us about **possible causes of performance problems**
* **Consistency problems**: indicate a lack in acquiring the basic movement pattern needed to perform the skill
* **bias problems**: indicate that the person has acquired the movement pattern but is having difficulties adapting to the specific demands of the performance situation

* **absolute error**: the absolute difference between the actual performance on each repetition and the goal. AE provides useful information about the **magnitude of error** a person has made on a repetition or over a series of repetitions and **a general index of accuracy**
* **constant error**: the signed (1/2) deviation from the target or criterion; it represents amount and direction of error and serves as a measure of **performance bias**.
* **variable error**: standard deviation of the person’s CE scores for the series of repetitions to measure **performance consistency**

### accessing continuous skills error
* **If a continuous skill need accuracy**: for example walk along a pathway, accessment is around how well the person stayed on the paythway. 
  * Error score is **root-mean-squared error** on pursuit tracking: use a cursor to track the pathway

### measurement of motor skill performance: two categories
* **performance outcome measures**: what happened at the level of actions, where the major concern is whether or not the goal of the task was accomplished. e.g. how fast a person ran a certain distance, and a baseball player’s batting average all are based on the outcome of the person’s performance. But POM do not tell us anything about the movements of the limbs, head, or body that led to the observed outcome
* **performance production measures**: performance characteristics that produced the outcome, e.g. how the nervous system is functioning, how the muscular system is operating, and how the limbs or joints are acting before, during, or after a person performs a skill. 
![](/assets/2025-01-23-performacne%20measurement.png)

### two part operational defination of motor learning [1]
* **skill acquisition**: the processes by which an individual acquires the ability to rapidly identify an appropriate movement goal given a particular task context, select the correct action given a sensory stimulus and/or the current state of the body and the world, and execute that action with accuracy and precision; 
* **skill maintenance**: the ability to maintain performance levels of existing skills under changing conditions. These two aspects of motor learning are each important in their own right, and they likely share overlapping neural circuitry. That said, it is also clear that the brain possesses dedicated mechanisms for skill maintenance, as we discuss in the section on adaptation.

### from motor learning to music motor learning
* Motor learning in sports and other gross motor learning, which will include easier access measurement, e.g. how fast a person ran a certain distance, and a baseball player’s batting average all are based on the outcome of the person’s performance. How to set measurement for music could varies based on the goal
