For my singing focus group paper, I want to use the TPACK framework for the paper to make the result more structured and convincing. 

## TPACK [1]
technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework. TPACK builds on Lee Shulman’s (1986, 1987) construct of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) to include technology knowledge and is effective teaching with technology . The framework is an extention of Shulman’s pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) construct to include educational technology (1986,1987). This framework explain how teachers understanding of educational technologies and interact with one another

### The three bodies of TPACK [1]:
* **content knowledge**: teachers’ knowledge about the subject matter to be learned or taught
As Shulman (1986) noted, this knowledge includes concepts, theories, ideas, organizational frameworks, evidence and proof, as well as established practices and approaches toward developing such knowledge.

* **pedagogy knowledge**: teachers’ deep knowledge about the processes and practices or methods of teaching and learning.
* **technology knowledge**: K in this manner enables a person to accomplish a variety of different tasks using information technology, and to develop different ways of accomplishing a given task. (This conceptualization of TK does not posit an “end state,” but rather sees it developmentally, as evolving over a lifetime of generative, open-ended interaction with technology.)

The interaction of these bodies produce the types of flexible knowledge needed to successfully integrate technology use into teaching .

### Interaction among the model

* **PCK (pedagogical content knowledge)**: knowledge of pedagogy that is applicable to teaching specific content
* **TCK (technological content knowledge)**: is an understanding of the manner in which technology and content influence and constrain one another
* **TPK (technological pedagogical knowledge)**: an understanding of how teaching and learning can change when particular technologies are used in particular ways.
  
*Teachers need to reject functional fixedness (Duncker, 1945) and develop skills to look beyond most common uses for technologies, reconfiguring them for customized pedagogical purposes.*

* **TPACK (technology, pedagogy, and content knowledge)**: an understanding that emerges from interactions among content, pedagogy, and technology knowledge. requiring an understanding of the representation of concepts using technologies, pedagogical techniques that use technologies in constructive ways to teach content, knowledge of what makes concepts difficult or easy to learn and how technology can help redress some of the problems that students face, knowledge of students’ prior knowledge and theories of epistemology, and knowledge of how technologies can be used to build on existing knowledge to develop new epistemologies or strengthen old ones.

### success TPACK
The TPACK framework suggests that content, pedagogy, technology, and teaching/learning contexts have roles to play individually and together. Teaching successfully with technology requires continually creating, maintaining, and re-establishing a dynamic equilibrium among all components

### What is technology??
Technology refers to the application of scientific knowledge, skills, and tools to solve problems or create useful items that improve our lives. It doesn't have to be digital or high-tech—it can be as simple as a tool designed to achieve a specific purpose.

Thomas Friedman (2006) credited technology with being an integral contributor to flattening the world—reducing and in some cases eliminating geographic, financial, and other constraints that affect the way people live and work. [3]

Technology is the collection of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. . . . Technology can be most broadly defined as the entities, both material and immaterial, created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value. In this usage, technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve real-world problems. [wiki]
### Pedagogical technology characterization [1] (Simon, 1969)
Traditional pedagogical technologies are characterized by 
* specificity, e.g. a pencil, a microscope is for viewing small objects
* stability, e.g. pencils, pendulums, and chalkboards have not changed a great deal over time
* transparency of function, inner workings of the pencil or the pendulum are simple and directly related to their function.
*Over time, these technologies achieve a transparency of perception, and become a commonplace in most cases.*

Digital technologies suhc as computers, handhelf devices, and software:
* **protean**: usable in many different ways
* **ubstable**: rapidly changing
* **opaque**: the inner workings are hidden from users
*The OPAQUE makes it different to teachers to offers, so make it less stability than teaditional technologies

### teaching and technology's relationship: need first or technology first??
Also complicating teaching with technology is an understanding that technologies are neither neutral nor unbiased. Rather, particular technologies have their own **propensities, potentials, affordances, and constraints** that make them more suitable for certain tasks than others

* Social and contextual factors: Many teachers earned degrees at a time when educational technology was at a very different stage of development than it is today.Thus, it is not surprising that they do not consider themselves sufficiently prepared to use technology in the classroom and often do not appreciate its value or relevance to teaching and learning.
* Moreover, this knowledge is unlikely to be used unless teachers can conceive of technology uses that are consistent with their existing pedagogical beliefs
* teachers have often been provided with inadequate training for this task. Many approaches to teachers’ professional development offer a one-size-fits-all approach to technology integration when, in fact, teachers operate in diverse contexts of teaching and learning.

**Need to treat teaching as an interaction between what teachers know and how they apply the knowledge in the contexts/circumstances in their classrooms**

**There is no one best way!**

**Integration efforts should be creatively designed or structured for particular subject matter ideas in specific classroom context**

why its integration not design for specific purpose??


### Limitation of TPACK in used at music pedagogy

* **Teacher oriented**: the framework is to describe *teacher's knowledge*. So how to take both teacher and students into consideration?
* **Teaching itself is illstructured** (requiring teachers to apply complex knowledge structures across different cases and contexts (Mishra, Spiro, & Feltovich, 1996; Spiro & Jehng, 1990)[1]) music embodied teaching, is more complex and illstructured.
* **The perspective of technology being considered: analog and digital**
* **Didn't tell how the interaction can be**
* **Its hard for a human teacher to get comprehensive knowledge in their body and also in their music**: The cost of not having a comprehensive base of content knowledge can be prohibitive; for example, students can receive incorrect information and develop misconceptions about the content area (National Research Council, 2000; Pfundt & Duit, 2000); demonstrate, issues relating to curriculum content can be areas of significant contention and disagreement.
* TPACK is usually used for measure or assess the teacher's help with technology in their teaching, to determine the impact of interventions and, professional development programs, or to descriptively characterize the current state of teacher knowledge. Is there any papers that use TPACK in designing new technology?
- a intergration participatory design method: involving the TPACK not only the design method but also the evaluation tool
* classroom and school factors and those related to teachers were more likely to be included than those related to students and society [2]
* Inclusive and accessible
