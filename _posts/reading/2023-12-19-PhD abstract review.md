## Smart Environments with Wide-Area Sensors
### Zhang Yang, CMU HCI PhD 2020

BG: ‚ÄúThe Computer for the 21st Century‚Äù [155] (Mark Weiser) depicted the future of computing:
The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.

Application: extends computer applications into common physical spaces

Key issue: 
1) smart home devices is not smart: incapablt to the closest things around them
2) object borne sensors have challenges
   cost, user maintenance and sensing versatility

Solution: wide-area sensing systems. Conducted a series of background investigations and system performance evaluations to prove that such wide-area sensing systems can be low-cost, low-maintenance, and general-purpose while being able to sense rich signals. 
## The Creation of Hardware Systems for Professional Artistic Productions
### Ian Hattwick
Application : design of digital musical instruments
Challenges: moving new instruments to the professional concert stage presents an additional set of challenges that encompass issues of technical design, use in artistic practice, manufacturing, and longterm usability
Aolution: present a framework (from three hardware systems) consisting of seven design aspects: functionality, aesthetics, support for artistic creation, system architecture, manufacturing,
robustness, and reusability. 

## My thinking
BG: haptic in music üëç

application: haptics-aided singing education interface

Problems: 
* traditional singing education: confusing feelings and descriptive directives;
* device: onoffset/intensity/frequency, not into actual breathing pattern

solution: haptic directive. Combine experience in sports training, rehabilitation and emotion/stress regulation

First step:
1. identify problems: find which effective technique will lead to confusing feelings and descriptive directives are hard to convey to students; find what are the limitation in existing application.
2. find possible technology in s/r/e or new technology which can use haptic directive
3. explore
