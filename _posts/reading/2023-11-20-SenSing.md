These days, I always came up with some new ideas about SenSing. I can feel my endless energy in music education and singing, but thinking without hands-on prototyping makes me nervous. So I starts the READ NIME WITH ME program as the academic diary of paper reading which can also leave me some records for my comprehensive exam and further PhD work.

The topics of today's reading is related to SenSing project: EMS/EMG, knowledge transfer, and motion learning in ***NIME & Augmented Human & CHI etc***. conferences.

## Topic: SenSing

### Arduino-based portable system for bioelectrical impedance measurement
Authors: Simone Corbellini, Alberto Vallan  
Keywords: ***Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) => bioelectrical impedance analysis(BIA)***, ***monitor the amount of fat and liquids***   
Short abstract: This paper describes an extremely low cost implementation of an EIS system suitable for medical applications that is based on a simple commercial Arduino Board whose cost is below 50$. Aim for ascites(腹水)， abdomen area

## which muscles for measuring?
### Electrical Muscle Stimulation for Deep Stabilizing Muscles in Abdominal Wall
Core: Specifically, previous research has shown us that people with LBP have a greater tendency to activate their superficial abdominal muscle groups such as the rectus abdominus, external oblique (EO) and the long extensor muscles of the spine during functional tasks [6]. Conversely, healthy individuals have greater bias towards use of their deep stabilizing muscle groups such as transversus abdominis (TrA) and lumbar multifidus [7]-[11]. 

Effective therapeutic exercises must preferentially involve activation of deep muscles such as TrA with minimal co-activation of superficial muscles such as EO. 

Finally, they test TrA and EO

### GRAB-AND-PLAY MAPPING: CREATIVE MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES FOR MUSICAL INCLUSION AND EXPLORATION
Authors: Hugo Scurto, Rebecca Fiebrink
Abstract: A tool: briefly observes a user interacting with a controller or sensors (without making any sound), and then it automatically generates a mapping from this observed input space to the control of an arbitrary sound synthesis program.
