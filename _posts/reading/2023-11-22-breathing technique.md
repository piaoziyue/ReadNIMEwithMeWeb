### => Singing Terminology Usage: A Quantitative, Inter-Disciplinary Study, PhD 2016

#### definitions -- breathing support
* “a dynamic relationship between the breath and the vocal cords which determines how long you can sing on one breath” for voice practitioners
* “concerned with
delaying both the collapse of the ribs and the reversion of the diaphragm to its dome-shaped position,”  for voice teachers
  
## singing pedagogy situations
diaphragm: how can we detect its movement/muscle activity

### => Breathing and Support chapter from "Diagnosis & Correction of Vocal Faults, James McKinney"

#### differences between natural breathing and singing breathing
* the amount of conscious control exerted

### natural breathing

#### breathing three stages (not contiously control)
* a slow intake of air
* a release of air
* waiting or recovery period before the next intake

#### breathing machanics
* action of diaphragm muscle
* partial vacuum in the lungs
* external atmosphere pressure greater than internal
* air enters the body through nose and/or mouth, passing through two songy, elastic, saclike organs, 

#### diaphgram mechanics
![](../images/2311w3_2.jpeg)
* diaphragm: double domes, attach to the breastbone, the lowest ribs and the backbone
* ribs: front higher than the back, so the diaphragm is lower in the back than the front

* the muscle fibers of diaphragm are contracted
* the dome of the diaphragm is lowered
* viscera(内脏) below it are compressed & relaxed abdominal muscles -> visible movement in the upper abdomen
* lungs are stretched downward
* the effective capacity of the lungs are increased
* partial vacuum -> cause outside air into the body

#### main muscles in inhale
* primary: diaphragm
* assisted: external rib (intercostal) muscles ![](../images/2311w3_3.png)
* assisted: relaxation of the upper abdomen

#### main muscles in exhalation
* external obliques
* internal intercostals

#### labored breathing(吃力的) caused by
* strenuous exertion: various other muscle of the shoulders, back, chest are brought into action

#### machanics of exhalation
* diaphragm relaxed
* lungs are elastic and tend to return to its original shape ( when the diaphragm stretching them)
* the abdominal organs and abdominal wall return to their original shape and location, because the diaphragm quits pushing against and compressing them
* (when exertion increase, this is the prominent process) the internal rib muscles and abdominal muscles assist in the expulsion of air
  
### singing breathing

#### breathing stages in singing (under conscious control until conditioned reflex)
* breathing in (inhalation), mouth & nose not only nose for quickly getting more air
  * quicker
  * quantity of air greater
  * deeper than natural breathing
  * front expand more than side or back of the body because the attachment from diaphragm to the skeleton is higher in the front; with the same effort, front is easier to expand
  * well inhalation: noiseless, effortless and non-audible; upper abdomen is free to move, the side and back of the body is expanded but the front expanded the most.
* setting up controls (suspension)
* controlled exhalation period (phonation)
* recovery period

#### how to condition inhale reflex
* pretend you are smelling a flower
* pretend beginning a yawn: notice jaw drop, soft pallete

Ralph Appelman 1967 classification of breathing

![](../images/2311w3_SenSing_Appelman.png)

* Clavicular breathing: is identified by a predominant expansion in the extreme upper chest accompanied by a raising of the shoulders and clavicles during inspiration

* thoracic breathing: identified as rib or costal breathi

## what are the main problems in singing pedagogy related to breathing/motor learning?


### how can we know these problems
* focus group
* review
* ?


## what are the main technology used in music pedagogy

### technology in singing pedagogy

## what are the main technology used in rehabilitation and motor learning
