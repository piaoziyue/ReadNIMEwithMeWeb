> What is the role and relevance of the body in social interaction and cognition? There is no single, simple answer to this question. 
> 1) The body has no role at all, other than a mere implementation of a computational process as stated above by Gardner [1]. 
> 2) Body plays a crucial role in the shaping of the mind as the quote by Varela et al. [2]
> 3) Dominant view of the role of the body in social interaction and cognition, body is as a trivial ‘appendage’ to the real intellectual language and mind.

> Bodily aspects are frequently addressed in terms of nonverbal communication, nonverbal behavior, or body language. However, it has been estimated that almost two thirds of the meaning in a social situation are conceived from these ‘nonverbal signs’ (cf. e.g. [6]), whereas speech has been estimated to account for merely some few percent (cf. e.g. [7]).

- Embodied Cognition: Focuses on how our body influences our mind.
- Situated Cognition: Emphasizes the role of environmental and contextual factors in shaping cognition.
- Distributed Cognition: Highlights the spread of cognitive processes across individuals, objects, and environments.

> One might say a Copernican revolution within the cognitive sciences—from the traditional cognitivist perspective, (cf. Gardner’s quote above) which considers cognition in terms of internal symbolic representations and computational processes—to emphasizing the way cognition is shaped by the body and its sensorimotor interaction with the surrounding world (cf. e.g. [2, 8–18]). This is a reaction against the cognitivists’ computer metaphor of mind, which is a centralized view of cognition taking place inside the skull with the body only serving as some kind of input and output device, i.e. a physical interface between an internal program (cognitive processes) and an external world. Thus, embodiment has become a much discussed concept [19–22] which many regard, together with situatedness, to be the defining feature of a new approach to the study of cognition. Usually referred to as ‘embodied cognitive science’ it portrays a much more complex picture of the mind.

> By taking a situated, distributed and embodied perspective, it has been suggested that the external environment can be used as a kind of extension of our mind, since these external structures function to complement our individual ‘skin and skull’.

> In order to exemplify the close interrelatedness between the so-called ‘biological’ and ‘cultural’ aspects, one can use Ingold’s [24] example of learning to walk as an illustration. It is commonly argued that walking is an innate human capability, but Ingold does not categorize human walking as either biological or cultural. A child learns to walk according to the standard manner of its social and cultural environ- ment, which is reinforced by biological aspects. Some cultures encourage children to start walking at a very early age, as in Western societies, and therefore different physical scaffolds are used to encourage their motoric development. Other cultures actively delay their children’s initial walking attempts, and actually hinder their motoric development. Furthermore, different ways of walking are culture-dependent (e.g. [25]). Therefore, there is no one ‘natural’ or ‘pure’ biological way of walking, as one might assume. This means, the human skill of walking can be viewed as not only ‘biological’ in the sense of being a part of the functions of the individual human’s biology, but also a result of the child’s involvement in a social and physical world during normal development.

> Accordingly, it has been argued that cognition is not an activity of the mind alone, since the mind is ‘leaking’ out to the environment, to use Clark’s [8] vocabulary. Instead, cognition is distributed across the agent, the actual situation and its resources. This has led to the claim that the environment is a part of the cognitive system (cf. e.g. [8, 9, 15, 21, 30–33]). It is therefore very difficult to determine what the actual ‘border’ is between our senses and the world, since it is impossible to draw a sharp line between what goes on ‘inside’ the mind and what takes place in the world. To summarize, culture and language are considered our most significant scaffolds [8].

> Why neglect the body in mainstream cognitive science: 
> 1) it is a consequence of the Platonic-Cartesian heritage, which has resulted in the view of the mind as the inter- nal locus of rationality, thought, language and knowledge (for criticisms of that view, cf. e.g. [16, 34–41]), which is supported by the Christian disregard of the flesh as the locus of sinful desire and irrationality (but see also Barbour1). 
> 2) Dualism二元论： Moreover, the opposite dimensions have been mapped on each other, resulting in the dualisms of, for instance, mind/body, mental/behavior, reason/emotion, and subjective/objective.
> 3) On the other hand, researchers commonly overlook the role of the body because they are afraid of slipping into biological reductionism, and therefore they generally tend, or prefer to view mind as superior to and independent of the body (see e.g. [43–45]).
>
> Embodiment does not imply that the body alone without the brain. Instead, embodiment stresses the interplaybetween the environment, brain and the sensorimotor processes of the rest of thebody, which are pivotal for cognitive activity to take place.
>> As Lakoff and Johnson ([17], p. 265)characterize it,… the mind is embodied, not in any trivial sense (e.g. then “wetware” of the brain runs the“software” of the mind), but in the deep sense that our conceptual systems and our capacityfor thought are shaped by the nature of our brains, bodies, and bodily interactions. Thereis neither no mind separated from and independent of the body, nor are there thoughts thathave an existence independent of our bodies and brains.

> Metaphorically speaking,Chiel and Beer [96] emphasize that the relationship between the brain and the bodyshould be viewed as a group of players in a jazz improvisation, rather than seeingthe brain as the conductor of an orchestra (i.e. the rest of the body). This means thatthe r ole of the whole ‘bodily’ nervous system “is not so much to direct or programbehavior as they shape it and evoke the appropriate patterns of dynamics from theentire coupled system” ([96], p. 555). 

> Overlapping names: Accordingly,a number of overlapping, but not necessarily identical embodied views emergedunder various names, such as embodied action [9], embodied cognition [8], embod-ied intelligence [10], embodied cognitive science (cf. [8, 11–15]), embodied mind[9], and embodied AI [16]. 

Question to be further think about embodied AI:
> Today, many cognitive scientists as well as AI researchers believe that beingembodied is a core property for intelligence both in humans and artiﬁcial systems.However, if we take the stance that human cognition actually is embodied, whatexactly does that mean? Are humans embodied due to their physical nature, theirphenomenological nature, biological/evolutionary history, or their individual devel-opmental and social history?

Embodiment defination: 
> One way to ﬁnd a contemporary deﬁnition of the concept of embodiment is to lookin The Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science, i n which ‘embodiment’ is characterizedby Chrisley and Ziemke [27] as follows:An understanding of how cognition is realized or instantiated in a physical system, especiallya body, may require or be required by an account of a system’s embedding in its environment,its dynamical properties, its (especially phylogenetic) history and (especially biological)function, and its nonrepresentational or noncomputational properties (p. 1102).

> As previously stated, while appearance so far has received much attention in discus-sions of embodied cognition, the crucial role of the body in motion has received very little, although research in various domains has shown the relevance of locomotion experience to human cognition (cf. e.g. [31, 32, 89–93]). __Furthermore, Trevarthen and Hubley ([94], in [3]) pointed out that a practical motive is another reason for the neglect of dynamical aspects in psychological research.__ Since bodily movement pat-terns of humans were difﬁcult to observe with the technology of the time, cognitive science consequently became more of a static science of perception, cognition and action than a science of embodied dynamic interactions. Moreover, Varela (in [95],p. 23), for example, states that “[s]ocial scientists are body-dead because they are conceptually brain-dead to signifying acts within the semiotics of body movements”(p. 23). However, when researchers actually paid attention to embodied movement, it often appeared that, as Farnell formulates it, ‘the moving body has lost its mind’ [95]. Merleau-Ponty (see Sect. 2.4.2) is commonly viewed as the ‘Knight of the Body’,he actually overlooked the deeply ingrained role of self-experienced movement inembodied beings. She also claims that the core of being is the relation between thebody and movement, stressing “consciousness does not arise in matter; it arises inorganic forms, forms that are animate” (p. 43). In general, the human experience ofmovement is stunning. Human infants are not born inanimate, but already moving, asfetuses beginning to produce self-induced movements somewhere between ﬁve andsix weeks after conception, shortly after developing body parts with which to move.Already at 12 weeks, a majority of the fetuses’ arm movements are directed towardsomething, such as their own faces and bodies, and the environmental features of thewomb [89]. There is hence a need to discover how we ‘put ourselves together’, inorder to catch ourselves in the tactile-kinesthetic ‘apprenticeship’ of our own bodies[93]

> She notes that althoughMerleau-Ponty (see Sect. 2.4.2) is commonly viewed as the ‘Knight of the Body’,he actually overlooked the deeply ingrained role of self-experienced movement inembodied beings. 

Gallagher, S.: How the Body Shapes the Mind. Oxford University Press, Oxford (2005)
> Gallagher [91, 96] proposes that a conceptual distinction between bodyimage and body schema is needed. Phenomenological reﬂection impliesthe difference between taking an intentional attitude towards one’s own body as wellas having a capacity to move or to exist in the action of one’s own body. The conceptsof body image and body schema relate to this phenomenological difference [91]. The two systems interact and are highly coordinated; in the context ofintentional action, as well as in pragmatic and socio-cultural contexts [91]
> - Body image consists of a system of perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs pertaining to one’sbody. 
> - Body schema is a system of sensorimotor capacities that function without awareness or thenecessity of perceptual monitoring (p. 24).

Movement in cognitive development
> With regard to the role of movement in cognitive development, research in motordevelopment has usually been considered with the mere study of physical growth,motoric milestones, and so on, __but there is emerging empirical evidence revealinginteresting and important links between cognitive and motoric functions (cf. e.g. [32,89])__. Traditionally, the systems of perception and action have been considered ashaving no essential contact with each other, as well as constituting separate researchareas where perception is the dominant object of study, and action has been neglected[92]. Hurley argues against the traditional “Input-Output picture” of perception andaction, following in the footsteps of Dewey’s work on the reﬂex arc (see Sects. 2.2and 2.4.5). Most generally, __she portrays the mainstream view of the mind as a kind of sandwich, with perception as the bottom slice, actions as the top slice, and cognition as the ﬁlling in between, thus implying that perception and action operate separately[92]__. However, she emphasizes that perception, action, and environment are deeplyintertwined, stressing perception and action are interdependent of each other, giventhat action shapes perception as much as perception shapes action in a continuouslyevolving loop. Following the sandwich metaphor, Hurley argues cognition is liketaking a substantial bite in the sandwich, i.e. biting through the top slice, the ﬁllingand the bottom slice at once, not eating the different parts separately.

> Johnson and Rohrer [101], for instance,point out that “embodied cognition is often social and carried out cooperativelyby more than one individual

> Moreover, they note that although the embodied approach has challenged the mind/body dualism at the individual level, the dualistic stance between the individual and society is still present.

Charles Taylor's 1993
> Our body is not just the executants of the goals we frame or just the locus of the causal factors which shape our representations. Our understanding itself is embodied. That is, our bodily know-how and the way we act and move can encode components of our understanding of self and world

Antonio Damasio 1995
> The body, as represented in the brain, may constitute theindispensable frame of reference for neural processes that weexperience as the mind; that our very organism rather thansome absolute external reality is used as the ground referencefor the constructions we make of the world around us and for theconstruction of the ever-present sense of subjectivity that is partand parcel of experiences; that our most reﬁned thoughts andbest actions, our greatest joys and deepest sorrows, use the bodyas a yardstick.

### History of cognitive science about embodiment:

#### 1) Dualism: Plato to Descartes:
 - Plato(428/427 BC–348/347 BC) argued that all knowledge has to be described in a formof pure explicit deﬁnitions. As a consequence, he believed that phenomena thatcould not be formalized explicitly, for example, bodily skills and feelings, couldnot count as knowledge. He therefore made a distinction between the rational mindand the body with its emotions and skills. He admitted that there is some kind ofconnection between the two of them, but he never explained how it worked.
 - This conceptual separation of mind and body was conﬁrmed by Aristotle who divorced the practical from the theoretical and deﬁned the human beingas ‘the rational animal’.
 - The French philosopher René Descartes (1596–1650) also claimed that the mindis separated from the physical body, resulting in the concepts of two different sub-stances, and formulated the dualistic viewpoint. Descartes’ assertion is primarily disembodied in the sense that heviewed the mind as a non-physical substance, with almost no connection to the body,arguing that the human soul actually ruled the mind and directed the body how tobehave. 
 - Descartes demonstrated or believed he demonstrated the need ofa uniquely human soul as the ‘pilot of the corporeal boat’, since he was aware ofthe boundaries of this mechanistic view of non-human beings.

#### 2) Darwin:
- Darwin himself certainly believed there was a mental linkage between animalsand humans, although this was a standpoint that many people, not least in VictorianEngland, had difﬁculties in accepting. Many agreed that the theory was adequatefor animals, but not for humans who where considered unique due to ‘their specialminds’ [9, 17]. 
- However, Sheets-Johnstone[19] argued that these lines in Darwin’s work have been misinterpreted. Instead ofstudying the mind “as the function of the body”, researchers have reduced the bodyand its interactions with the environment to include only the brain itself.
- However, Darwin focused primarily on facial expressions and paid little atten-tion to gesture and body language, which he considered the product of sociallylearned conventions, only mentioning their communicative role in a few words,and did not elaborate on them further. 
- __According to Ekman [20], Darwin’s rea-son for ignoring these communicative features could have been an overreaction toBell’s claim that human expressions were God’s gift to mankind.__
- Darwin’s work was in fact a serious attack against dualism, but the message was notrecognized. This can be partly explained by his co-worker Wallace’s personal view,which did not support the anti-dualistic stance. Wallace was actually devoted to theCartesian worldview, arguing that human mental abilities have to be explained insupernatural terms, as a kind of soul [15]. 
- Clever Hans,which was one of the most famous examples of ‘intelligent’ animals in the early1900s [10, 17, 23]. His owner believed that animals were as clever as humans, ifthey were given the opportunity to become educated. He therefore trained his horseHans, which apparently turned out to possess remarkable cognitive capabilities. Con-sequently, ‘Clever Hans’ was regarded as a prodigy, since the horse was able to solve mathematical problems and answer questions, by tapping the correct answer with his front leg. Thesevisual hints cued ‘Clever Hans’, since the questioner unconsciously altered body and/or head posture(s) when the horse reached the correct number of hoof taps, as a kind of involuntary relaxation of the “pressure” of the situation.  According to Knapp andHall [26], it has been demonstrated that horses are able to recognize changes in bodilypostures as tiny as 0.2 mm, such as slightly dilated nostrils. 
- Another proponent of mechanistic theories was Sherrington (1857–1952) whostudied and identiﬁed reﬂexes. He illustrated in The Integrative Action of the NervousSystem [29] how the nervous system integrated reﬂexes into adaptive behaviors andexplained in what ways reﬂexes operated. Sherrington declared that the reﬂex was thefundamental unit of behavior, characterized by the reﬂex arc. He argued that this reﬂexarc was organized in three distinct structures; an effector organ which was stimulussensitive, being wired via a nervous pathway to a receptor which initiated a response[24]. Thus, the behavior of the body was predetermined by the wiring of the nervoussystem that linked stimulus to response. Furthermore, Sherrington claimed that thisnotion of reﬂexes was an abstraction, arguing that no part of the nervous system couldreact without affecting the whole nervous system, since all parts were intertwinedtogether (see [12, 13]). 

- Sherrington's Reflex Theory: Sherrington proposed that reflexes are the fundamental units of behavior, organized into a reflex arc involving an effector organ, a nervous pathway, and a receptor. He argued that the nervous system's wiring predetermined behavior, integrating reflexes into adaptive actions. Sherrington also suggested that the nervous system's reflexes were interconnected, impacting the entire system rather than acting independently.

- Tropism and Animal Behavior: The concept of tropism, initially related to plants, was extended by Loeb to describe animal behavior. Despite some confusion between tropism and taxes (movement in response to stimuli), the study of these concepts became significant in understanding animal behavior.

- Experimental Psychology and Ethology: The field split into experimental psychology, focusing on learning and intelligence, and ethology, studying animal behavior and perception. This division led to different research methods and a lack of communication between physiological and behavioral studies.

- The initial description of the reﬂex arc implied a neural circuitry of ‘coor-dinated action’ [29], but the psychologists considered it as two distinct units [16].They assumed that this process began with the stimulation of the organism, whichinitiated some sort of a mental act or awareness, resulting in a response.
- 
- Dewey's Critique and Sensory-Motor Coordination: John Dewey criticized the traditional view of the reflex arc as a linear process, proposing instead that sensory and motor activities are part of a continuous coordination [35]. He emphasized that actions are not merely responses to stimuli but are integrated, ongoing processes that encompass both sensation and movement.
    > the seeing stimulates another act,the reaching, it is because both of these acts fall within a larger coordination; because seeingand grasping have been so often bound together to reinforce each other, to help each otherout, that each may be considered practically a subordinate member of a bigger coordination

- Behaviorism's Emergence: In the early 20th century, behaviorism arose, rejecting the introspectionist and functionalist focus on mental processes. Behaviorists, like Skinner, argued that behavior should be understood in terms of observable actions and their associations with stimuli, dismissing the relevance of the mind or bodily contributions to behavior.

#### 3) Behaviorism
- Core Principles of Behaviorism:
  - Focus on Observable Behavior: Behaviorism emphasized studying only observable stimuli and responses, avoiding any speculation about internal mental states. This approach rejected the concept of instincts and asserted that all behaviors are learned through conditioning, including physiological processes like respiration and circulation.
  
  - Equipotentiality: The theory posited that all organisms have the same potential for learning any behavior, with no inherent preference for specific stimulus-response associations.
  
- Behaviorists followed Darwin’s statement of a “mental continuum” between animal and man, then arguing that animals could be viewed as simple models of human learning. Thus, behaviorism was the ﬁrst rigorous attack against the dualistic assumption, since it totallyignored any mental content. However, little, if any, interest was directed towards inwhat ways an organism was embodied. Hence, research on the role and relevance ofbodily contributions to cognition was overwhelmed by the tide of behaviorism (cf.e.g. [3, 10, 15, 23, 37])
  
- Russian scholar Pavlov [16, 17].Pavlov studied the mechanisms of digestion in dogs and regarded the biologicalbody as a machine (following the mechanical view), arguing the digestive systemfunctions like a factory. He measured the quantity of saliva produced during feedingin the dog’s mouth and discovered the conditioned reﬂexes, arguing they were the“atoms of action”.

- Watson, influenced by Pavlov's work, argued that all behaviors are the result of learning and conditioning. He dismissed the notion of instincts, claiming that what were previously considered instincts were actually learned behaviors.
  - He suggested that human and animal behavior are fundamentally similar, allowing the study of animals to provide insights into human behavior.

- Skinner further developed behaviorism, advocating for treating the mind as a "black box"—something that should not be investigated or speculated about, as behavior could be fully explained through conditioning without reference to mental states or processes.
    - He emphasized classical and operant conditioning as the sole mechanisms through which behaviors are acquired.
- Limitations: Despite its emphasis on objectivity, behaviorism faced criticism for being overly simplistic and ignoring mental processes. Critics pointed out phenomena that couldn't be explained solely by behavioristic principles and argued for the importance of considering mental content. Critique of Behaviorism:
Behaviorism, which focused on observable behaviors and dismissed internal mental states, was increasingly criticized. Noam Chomsky's review of B.F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior highlighted the limitations of behaviorism in explaining complex human behaviors like language use. The cognitive revolution emphasized studying the internal processes that behaviorism had neglected, marking a shift towards understanding the mind's "mentalistic" aspects.

#### 4) Beyond behavirorism
##### a) Ethology
- The passage discusses the contributions and perspectives of von Uexküll and other ethologists on animal behavior and instinct. Von Uexküll introduced the concept of "life-energy" in living organisms, distinct from mechanical or physical energy, allowing cells to respond meaningfully to stimuli. He argued that unlike machines, which operate mechanically and have fixed structures, living organisms are capable of growth and self-regeneration.

- Ethologists like Tinbergen and Lorenz expanded on these ideas, identifying key concepts such as sign stimuli, releasers, and innate release mechanisms (IRMs). These terms describe how specific stimuli can trigger instinctive behaviors in animals, which are often species-specific and genetically determined. Examples include the fixed-action patterns (FAPs) observed in animal behaviors, such as gull chicks pecking at red spots to receive food or geese retrieving eggs with a standardized motion.

- This work laid the foundation for ethology, the comparative study of behavior, which considers the evolutionary, physiological, and developmental aspects of behavior in animals. The framework has also been applied to human behavior, though there is debate about whether the studied "natural" human behaviors accurately represent true human nature, as all humans exist within cultural and social contexts.

##### b) Gestalt School
- The predecessor of the Gestalt school was Ehrenfels’ work in the 1890s,on melody perception, the real starting point was Wertheimer’s book concerning thevisual perception of movement in 1912 and later studies conducted together with hisassistants Köhler and Koffka [6]. __They noticed that in human perception, the overallcharacteristics of an object, as its main shape or contour, were of greater importancethan the partial elements.__

- The answer to a problem resulted in a form of a gestalt, explained as a ‘picture in the mind’,an ‘insight’ or a kind of ‘aha-experience’. Consequently, Gestaltists concluded that“the whole is more than the sum of its parts”. 
- 
- the Gestalt approach lacked a theoretical foundation for the percep-tual phenomena observed, and as a result the research ﬁeld failed to maintain itsinﬂuential and central position

##### c) Gibson (1950-1979)
- some of the ideas of the Gestalt schoolwere used as a foundation for the work of Gibson, who developed an ecological approach to perception.
- Gibson emphasized the idea of "direct perception," where organisms perceive the environment without needing intermediary cognitive processes. He argued that the environment contains "affordances," or actionable properties, that are directly perceived by organisms. These affordances provide immediate information about how objects can be used, allowing for a seamless interaction between the organism and its surroundings.
- In Gibson's view, perception is not a passive process of receiving sensory data to be interpreted by the brain. Instead, it is an active process involving the organism's engagement with its environment. This approach suggests that perception and action are closely linked, as organisms can directly perceive relevant environmental information and respond appropriately without the need for a step-by-step cognitive process.
- __Thus, Gibson's ideas emphasize the importance of the relationship between an agent (organism) and its environment, making his approach an example of situated and embodied cognition. This perspective acknowledges that intelligent behavior arises from the dynamic interaction between the organism and the surrounding world.__
  
##### d) Merleau-Ponty: phenomenology (1945)
- Maurice Merleau-Ponty's philosophical ideas, emphasizing the role of the body in perception and action. Merleau-Ponty argues that organisms strive for an optimal interaction with their environment, a concept he describes as seeking the best "gestalt." This isn't a goal-directed activity but rather a fundamental motivation to achieve balance and equilibrium. He uses the example of an ideal viewing distance for an object or picture, where perception is clearest, to illustrate this concept.

- Merleau-Ponty introduces the concept of "the flesh," a fundamental substance that blurs the distinction between subject and object, suggesting that perception and action are deeply intertwined. This idea is illustrated by the dual nature of touch: when we touch something, we are also being touched, highlighting the inseparability of perceiver and perceived.

- He extends these ideas to human cultural practices, arguing that bodily actions and cultural skills, such as language and tool use, are learned through embodied experiences. He posits that language is an extension of bodily acts and that consciousness arises through verbalization.

- In summary, Merleau-Ponty rejects dualism and behaviorism, emphasizing the embodied nature of cognition. He argues that perception is an active process involving the body's intentional actions, influenced by cultural and psychological factors, rooted in his interest in Gestalt psychology.

##### e) The genetic epistemology of Piaget
### Summary and Explanation

**Jean Piaget's Genetic Epistemology**:
Jean Piaget, a Swiss scholar, emphasized the importance of sensorimotor activity in the development of intelligent behavior. He developed a theory called genetic epistemology, which focuses on the origins (genesis) and development of knowledge (epistemology). Piaget's work sought to integrate biology and logic, offering a developmental perspective on knowledge formation, inspired by Kant's idea that knowledge depends on perceptual and conceptual abilities.

Piaget's theory of cognitive development is centered around the concept of **schemata** or action schemes—cognitive structures through which individuals organize and adapt to their environment. Schemata are not static; they evolve through processes of **assimilation** (integrating new experiences into existing schemata) and **accommodation** (modifying schemata in response to new experiences). The state of equilibrium is achieved when an individual's schemata are well adapted to the environment, with the balance between assimilation and accommodation.

##### f) Frederic Bartlett
- a book: Remembering—a Study in Experimental Psychologyand Social Psychology
- his studies on memory andpresented the foundation for his theory of schema, which later inﬂuenced the ﬁeldsof cognitive science and psychology [101]: Bartlett's concept of the active and constructive nature of cognition emphasizes that cognitive processes are not passive recordings of information but involve active engagement with experiences. This means that when we remember or think, we do not just retrieve stored data; instead, we reconstruct our experiences based on existing knowledge structures, known as schemas. These schemas are shaped by our past experiences and cultural context, influencing how we interpret new information.
  - Constructivist Theories in Education:
Constructivist theories, such as those by Jean Piaget and Jerome Bruner, emphasize that learning is an active process where learners construct new knowledge based on their experiences. These theories highlight the importance of prior knowledge and the active role of learners in interpreting information.

**Stages of Cognitive Development**:
Piaget identified four major stages in cognitive development:
1. **Sensorimotor Stage (0-2 years)**: Focuses on sensory experiences and motor activities.
2. **Preoperational Stage (2-7 years)**: Development of language and symbolic thinking, but dominated by egocentric thought.
3. **Concrete Operational Stage (7-11 years)**: Development of logical thought concerning concrete objects.
4. **Formal Operational Stage (11-15 years)**: Ability to think abstractly and hypothetically.

These stages represent a continuum, where each stage builds upon the previous ones, and cognitive development is seen as a process of constructing increasingly complex schemata.

**Key Factors in Development**:
Piaget identified several factors influencing cognitive development:
- **Maturation**: Biological growth processes.
- **Active Experience**: Interaction with the environment.
- **Social Interaction**: Exchange of ideas and cultural influences.
- **Equilibration**: The self-regulatory process of achieving balance between assimilation and accommodation.

**Importance of Social Interaction**:
While some have criticized Piaget for neglecting the social dimension, he acknowledged the role of socio-cultural factors in influencing the speed and extent of cognitive development. He noted that social exchanges among children and adults are crucial for the development of social knowledge, although he believed that these factors do not change the overall direction of cognitive development.

Piaget's work has been foundational in understanding cognitive development, highlighting the interaction between biological, experiential, and social factors in shaping intelligence and knowledge. His ideas continue to influence educational practices and developmental psychology.

##### g) The Cognitive Revolution:
- The decline of behaviorism and the rise of cognitive science, often referred to as the "cognitive revolution," were marked by the growing interest in internal mental processes. The advent of the computer and developments in information theory provided a new metaphor for the mind, suggesting that cognitive processes could be understood as information processing systems. Key events and figures in this revolution included:

- The Symposium on Information Theory (1956): Featured demonstrations like Newell and Simon's "Logic Theory Machine," which could prove logical theorems, and Noam Chomsky's presentation on transformational grammar, challenging behaviorist views on language.
- The Dartmouth Conference (1956): A pivotal meeting that brought together many founding figures of artificial intelligence, discussing the possibility of creating "thinking machines."
> The traditional view is a philosophical one. It has come out of two thousand years of philoso-phizing about the nature of reason. It is still widely believed despite overwhelming empiricalevidence against it … We have all been educated to think in those terms … Modern attemptsto make it work assume that rational thought consists of the manipulation of abstract symbolsand that these symbols get their meaning via a correspondence with the world, objectivelyconstructed, that is independent of the understanding of any organism … Though such viewsare by no means shared by all cognitive scientists, they are nevertheless widespread, and infact so common that many of them are often assumed to be true without question or comment(Lakoff, 1987, cited in [2] pp. 51–52)

**Connectionism and Neural Networks**:
Connectionism refers to a computational approach that models cognitive processes using artificial neural networks. These networks consist of interconnected nodes (neurons), where the connections have numerical weights that adjust based on input and learning processes. Unlike formalistic symbolic systems, neural networks can handle fuzzy input and are capable of learning through experience. This flexibility allows them to perform tasks like pattern recognition, where specific instructions are not explicitly programmed.

Neural networks function as self-organizing systems, similar to the brain's parallel processing capabilities. They enable cognitive processes to emerge from the patterns of activity within the network, suggesting that cognition is more about dynamic interactions than static symbol manipulation.

**Criticisms of Connectionism**:
1. **Symbol Grounding Problem**:
   Despite their advantages, neural networks face criticisms similar to those directed at representationalism and functionalism. One significant issue is the *symbol grounding problem*. While neural networks can represent properties in the world, these representations are still dependent on the initial specifications set by the designer. This means that the system does not inherently understand the symbols it uses; the meaning is assigned externally.

2. **Biological Plausibility**:
   Neural networks are often criticized for lacking biological realism. The simplified models used in these networks do not accurately represent the complexities of biological neurons. This trade-off between biological accuracy and computational efficiency may result in missing key aspects of natural intelligence.

3. **Lack of Evolutionary Explanations**:
   Another criticism is the lack of evolutionary context in connectionist models. While these models can simulate aspects of human intelligence, they do not explain how or why these cognitive abilities evolved. Understanding the evolutionary basis of intelligence is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of cognition.

**Embodiment and Situatedness**:
The discussion concludes by noting that both traditional cognitive science approaches (computationalism and connectionism) have generally neglected the role of embodiment, situatedness, and the environment. These elements are crucial for understanding cognition as they emphasize the interaction between an agent and its physical and social context. The integration of neural networks into physical robots, for example, might enhance their capacity for autonomous, intelligent behavior, suggesting a pathway towards more embodied and situated models of cognition.

**Related Work and Further Reading**:
1. **"Neural Networks and Artificial Intelligence: Applications and Implications"**: This book explores the development and applications of neural networks, along with their theoretical underpinnings and criticisms.
2. **"Embodied Cognition" by Lawrence Shapiro**: This text discusses the importance of considering the body and environment in cognitive processes, offering an alternative perspective to traditional cognitive science.

These resources provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of connectionism and the broader implications for the study of cognition.

### Social Embodied COgnition
#### the role of embodiment in social psychology, particularly focusing on how bodily states and experiences influence emotional and cognitive processes.

1. **Distinction Between Bodily and Feeling States**:
   - Niedenthal et al. highlight the importance of distinguishing between bodily states (physical manifestations of emotions) and feeling states (conscious awareness of these emotions). People often interpret their emotional experiences based on their beliefs about these bodily states rather than an accurate readout of the states themselves. This distinction helps explain inconsistencies in empirical findings about emotional experiences.

2. **Impact of Embodied States on Emotions**:
   - Empirical studies indicate that bodily expressions, such as posture, facial expressions, and vocalizations, can affect self-reported emotional feelings and other measures of emotional experience. These embodiments not only modulate existing emotions but can also generate corresponding emotional states. For example, adopting a specific posture or facial expression can induce the associated emotional feeling.

3. **Framework of Modality-Specific Reenactments**:
   - Barsalou et al. propose a framework for understanding social embodiment through modality-specific reenactments of perception, action, and introspection. This involves storing modality-specific states (like specific bodily or perceptual experiences) and later reenacting them through simulation. For instance, seeing a familiar face might trigger a specific conceptualization based on past experiences with similar faces.

4. **Situated Conceptualizations**:
   - Humans develop deep-rooted knowledge about frequently experienced situations, known as "situated conceptualizations." These are represented as simulations of situational components, such as relevant people, objects, and actions. When a current situation matches a previously experienced one, the corresponding conceptualization is activated, facilitating understanding and response.

5. **Critique and Limitations**:
   - While the framework emphasizes the role of perceptual and bodily states in cognitive processing, there is criticism that it still relies heavily on traditional representational theories. The concept of "situated conceptualizations" can be seen as similar to classical frames, with an added focus on embodiment. However, this approach might be considered a "weak" form of embodiment because it does not fully ground cognition in human bodily experience but rather imposes embodied constraints on information processing.

6. **Future Directions**:
   - The theory needs further refinement to adequately account for the mechanisms underlying social embodiment. There is also a need to better understand how the simulation of others' emotions contributes to the perceived meaning of social interactions, which involves understanding the underlying meaning of emotional experiences.

**Key Takeaway**:
The passage highlights the complexity of how embodied experiences influence cognitive and emotional processes. It suggests that while bodily states play a crucial role in shaping emotions and cognition, current theories may not fully capture the depth of this influence and require further development.

#### Mirror Neurons
- Simulation Theory: Mirror neurons activate when an individual observes another performing an action, allowing the observer to understand the action's meaning. This activation helps "tag" the observed action as belonging to the other person, aiding in attributing mental states to others (a process sometimes referred to as "mind-reading").
- Empathy and Emotions: Similar neural mechanisms are involved in both experiencing emotions and observing them in others. For instance, observing someone else's expression of disgust activates the same brain areas involved in experiencing disgust oneself, suggesting a shared neural basis for feeling and perceiving emotions.
- Gallagher's Non-Simulationist View: Gallagher proposes that mirror neurons and shared representations do not primarily facilitate internal simulation but rather direct intersubjective perception. For example, when infants imitate facial expressions, they do so by directly perceiving and responding to the expressions they see, without needing an internal simulation step.

#### Embodied linguistic
- Oro-Facial Movements and Gestures: In primates, communication primarily involved oro-facial movements. Manual gestures later complemented these movements, enhancing expressive capabilities. The combination of these elements paved the way for controlled vocalization and complex sound emission, which are crucial for human language.
- Integration of Gesture and Speech: According to McNeill, speech and gesture evolved together as a unified system. He emphasizes the thought-language-hand link, highlighting the role of areas 44 and 45 in Broca's area. Area 44 is involved in organizing action sequences, while area 45 contains mirror neurons, which respond to one's own actions and those of others. This co-optation enabled the integration of gesture and vocalization, embodying meaning and allowing for complex communication.
- Significance of Mirror Neurons:
Mirror neurons play a crucial role in recognizing and understanding the actions and intentions of others. McNeill suggests that these neurons became attuned to the significance of actions beyond mere movements, such as the concept of 'Upness' associated with an upward gesture. This relational aspect of gestures enables them to signify meanings beyond the actions themselves, a key feature in human communication.

> P131: Mirror neurons are certain kinds of neurons that become activated both when performing a specific action and when observing the same goal- directed movements of an experimenter (cf. e.g. [56, 85, 86]). It enables the agent to understand the meaning of the observed action by either activating (cf. [2]) or simulating (e.g. [52, 84, 86, 88]) the observed action through its own sensorimotor processes. Mirror neurons can be interpreted as representations of actions, used both for performing and understanding actions.

> As Goldin-Meadow explains, gesture may not onlyreﬂect thoughts it might also play a role in shaping thoughts, similarly as external-izing one’s problem by writing it down to solve it easier. [109] 
> [l]anguage is a modality of the human body. It is gen-erated out of movement” (p. 107) [2]
>Although gesture involves a direct mapping ofmeaning onto space and motion, it is not a kind of instrumental actions becausenormally gestures are neither controlled by the body schema nor by the body image.

##### Gesture
> It has been recognized that gesture4is a pan-human ability tightly connected and syn-chronized with speech (cf. e.g. [2, 98, 103, 108–110, 128–132 ]).
> “[g]estures donot just reﬂect thought but have an impact on thought. Gestures, together with lan-guage, help constitute thought … Gestures occur, according to this way of thinking,because they are a part of the speaker’s ongoing thought process” (p. 245, originalemphases) McNeil [108]

Criteria of gesture
- require that (i) the generation of hand movement takesplace during the communicative process of speaking, and (ii) that it is not a functionalact onan object or aperson [109].
- According toGoldin-Meadow [109, 128], various classiﬁcations of gestures exist, and McNeill[108], for instance, identiﬁes four different kinds of gestures that supplement speech. 
  - Iconic gestures obviously capture characteristics of the semantic content of speech.For example, making a twisting motion with ones hand while saying ‘I can’t openthis jar’.
  - Metaphoric gestures are similar to iconic gestures since they are pictorial, buttheir content is rather more abstract than concrete. For example, when presentingdifferent ideas these might be illustrated by treating them as bounded objectssupported by hand movements, i.e., making gestures t hat discretely represent theproposed ideas. In addition, the gestures may spatially reﬂect whether the ideasare closely related to each other or not.
  - Deictic gestures are ones that indicate objects, locations and other persons in thereal world, such as pointing to a person and saying ‘she is my brother’s girlfriend’.It should be noted that deictic gestures could be used although the entity is invisibleor not present. For instance, pointing at a chair to represent the person that earliersat on it.
  - Beat gestures catch the rhythmical pulsation of speech, and tend to bear the s ameform regardless of the content, for instance, moving one’s ﬁngers or hands up anddown, or back and fourth. They are usually generated with short, quick movements,and in order to put stress on a word, beat gestures demonstrate the signiﬁcant roleof that word in the discourse [108, 109, 128].
- Gallagher’s integrativetheory of gesture
  - gesture is supposed tobe 
    - (i)embodied, i.e., constrained and enabled by motoric possibilities; 
    - (ii), communicative; 
    - (iii), cognitive, i.e., contributing to the accomplishment of thought, and theshaping of mind. 
  - Gallagher, however, stresses that a total disregard of the movementnature of gesture would be a mistake, and he identiﬁes four different aspects ofmovements in gesture [2] 
    - Initiation of gesture is generally unconscious and tied to cognitive and commu-nicative requirements, but in some cases conscious control exercises veto powerover gestural movement.
    - Launching and timing are integrated with communicative and cognitive factors;which are tied to semantics and the pragmatics of t he situation.
    - Morphokinesis [shape] is integrated with communicative and cognitive factors tiedto semantics.
    - Topokinesis [location of one hand relative to the other and relative to other parts ofthe body] is dependent primarily on body-schematic processes and proprioceptionin the normal case (p. 123)

The section discusses four fundamental functions of the body in social interactions, emphasizing how embodiment influences and shapes these interactions. It highlights the interrelated nature of various modalities such as posture, emotion, speech, facial expression, and gesture, which work together rather than independently.

Four Fundamental Functions:
The Body as a Social Resonance Mechanism:

The body directly influences and reflects cognitive and affective states. For instance, bodily postures can affect emotional states, and emotions can affect bodily expressions. This bidirectional influence underscores the body's role in mirroring and resonating with others' behaviors and emotions.
The Body as Means and End in Social Interaction:

The body's sensorimotor processes are inherently cognitive, helping to perceive and understand actions. Mirror neurons play a key role in linking perception and action, allowing for the recognition of both the "what" and "why" behind observed actions. This suggests a unified view of social interaction that integrates internal and external perspectives.
Embodied Actions as a Helping Hand in Shaping and Sharing Thoughts:

Gestures complement speech and play a crucial role in expressing thoughts, especially those difficult to articulate. Gestures not only convey meaning but also help in processing and forming ideas. They operate both outwardly (communicating with others) and inwardly (structuring one's own thoughts).
The Body as a Representational Device:

Gestures can serve as symbols that represent certain actions or concepts. For instance, a twisting hand gesture can symbolize the action of opening a jar. This representational capacity of the body extends to embodying concepts and intentions, similar to how language works.

### Another future research task is to use the present work as a tentative approachfor the scientiﬁc challenge of creating an integrated cognitive science of HCI. Fur-thermore, in order to develop this integrated discipline, an embodied approach isbeen proposed (cf. e.g. [75, 90, 97, 98])

> By using the term  __embodied__ we mean to highlight two points: first, that cognition depends upon the kinds of experiences that come from having a body with various sensorimotor capacities, and second, that these individual sensorimotor capacities themselves are embedded in a more surrounding biological, psychological and cultural context.
